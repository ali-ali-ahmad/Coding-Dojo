<h1>Assignment: Routing Practice</h1>

<p>Create a simple React app that can handle the following routes:</p>
<ol>
    <li>localhost:3000/home: This should display the home page, with a generic "Welcome" heading</li>
    <li>localhost:3000/4: This should display the number "4", or any other number that was sent through</li>
    <li>localhost:3000/hello: This should display the word "hello" or any other word that was sent through</li>
    <li>localhost:3000/hello/blue/red: This should display the word "hello" in blue text with a red background. It should work with any other valid word and colors.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hint: use the <code>isNaN</code> method (is Not a Number). For example: <code>isNaN(+"35")</code> is <code>false,</code> <code>isNaN(+"hello")</code> is <code>true</code></p>
