<h1>Assignment: Box Generator</h1>

<p>Create a component with a form inside which accepts a color. When the form is submitted, add a box to the set of boxes with the appropriate color. You may use whichever method of styling you prefer; refer back to the end of the previous module (React Components) for more information on styling. The boxes should appear next to one another and wrap around if needed.</p>
