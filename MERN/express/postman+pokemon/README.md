<h1>Assignment: Postman + Pokemon</h1>

<p>With what we just learned, let's go ahead and use Postman with the Pokemon API. Use Postman to perform 5 different GET requests to retrieve 5 different Pokemon of your choice. Here is a link to the <a href="https://swapi.dev/">Pokemon API DOCS</a>.</p>

<p>For instance if we want to find a Pokemon named "Bulbasaur" we could make a request like this.</p>

<p>Or if we want to find a pokemon with an id of 25.</p>

<p>To do list:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make 5 different GET requests to retrieve 5 different pokemon</li>

</ul>
