<h1>Assignment: Convert to Arrow</h1>


<hr>

<p>You are at a company that does not have a great front end for its website, but they pride themselves on their JavaScript. Since they only care about adding random JavaScript functionality, they don't want you to change the CSS of this site. They have given you a task to update the Javascript in their site to ES6, so that every method being called uses arrow functions.</p>
<p>Take the following <a href="https://github.com/alirabah93/Coding-Dojo/tree/master/MERN/javaScript/fundamentals/ConvertToArrow/readMeFiles">HTML</a> and update all functions to arrow functions.</p>

<h4>To Do List</h4>

<p>Connect the EventListener `setBackgroundColorById` to the paragraph in the HTML</p>
