<h1>Assignment: Refactor, Reuse, Recycle</h1>

<p>You have just gotten a job as a Junior Developer for an e-commerce site. They are using a Product Manager (the assignment from the Full Stack MERN chapter) to manage their inventory.</p>
<p>The Senior Developer has noticed some redundancies in the code, and has tasked you with refactoring the code to create more reusable components.</p>
<p>Using the Product Manager assignment, make sure you are not repeating yourself. Rewrite your components so that you can reuse them.</p>
<p>Note: Refactoring is a very important skill to practice. In addition to the following tasks, see if there are any other improvements you can make to your code that may improve readability or reusability of code.</p>
