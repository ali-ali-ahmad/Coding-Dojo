<h1>Cafe Business Logic</h1>

<p>Now that you've familiarized yourself with Java a bit, you decided you really wanted to try and find an internship working on Cafe Java's dev team. After applying, you were sent descriptions of requested behavior for each of the methods needed for creating the <code>CafeUtil</code> library for their application, as well as some sample test cases.</p>

<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Write methods to solve basic business logic problems in Java.</li>
    <li>Practice <code>Array</code> and <code>ArrayList</code>.</li>
    <li>Practice <code>loops</code>.</li>
    <li>Understand the difference between printing and returning a value from a method.</li>
    <li>Create your own methods file</li>
    <li>Write a test file, and create an instance of another class to test the functionality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>CafeUtil File and TestCafe File</h2>

<p>For this assignment you will have two files, <code>CafeUtil.java</code> and <code>TestCafe.java</code>. You will be writing all your methods inside the <code>CafeUtil</code> class. The second file is a test file, <code>TestCafe.java</code> that includes the <code>main</code> method. We have provided the code in its entirety for testing, and you can copy and paste from it from the bottom of this module, but be sure to instantiate your class in the testing file!</p>

<h2>Assignment:</h2>

<p>Implement the four methods below. Important: Code all of the following methods in your <code>CafeUtil.java</code> file. </p>
