<h1>Book Club</h1>

<p>For this assignment, you'll be putting together all of the cumulative skills you have developed building full-stack applications. We recommend simply extending the functionality of your existing Login & Registration project, by adding a new model, Book. You'll also be implementing a one-to-many relationship between Books and Users. That is, users can post (create) many books, but books may only have one user who posted it.</p>

<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add users to an application with Create and Read capabilities.</li>
    <li>Implement a one-to-many relationship between User and another model.</li>
    <li>Identify and implement routes for requests based on a wireframe</li>
    <li>Manage a user session (log in status) by storing and reading their ID in session.</li>
    <li>Apply cumulative skills to build and de-bug a full-stack application.</li>
</ul>
