<p>Create a mini game that helps a ninja make some money! When you start the game, your ninja should have 0 gold. The ninja can go to different places to earn different amounts of gold. They can enter a farm, a cave, or a house for guaranteed gold. Your ninja can also go on a quest, where they can earn or LOSE up to 50 gold. Your job is to create a web app that allows this ninja to earn gold and to display past activities of this ninja.</p>

<p>You should only need 2 methods to complete this task. Hint: Use hidden inputs to differentiate the forms.</p>
