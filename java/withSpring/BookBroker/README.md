<h1>Book Broker</h1>

<p>For this assignment we'll be adding a new feature to your Book Club application, the Book Broker dashboard. You do not need to create a new project. In fact, you'll need to use the last assignment to build upon. However, you will be altering the relationships and models to add this functionality, so if all else fails, nuke your schema! Obviously, you would never do this in production, on a live site with customer data, but for now, feel free to wipe your schema as necessary while you work out the bugs.</p>

<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Implement full CRUD, adding update and delete to your application.</li>
    <li>Implement multiple one-to-many relationships in an application.</li>
    <li>Alter assign and re-assign many-to-one relationships.</li>
    <li>Use a nullable field in a relationship.</li>
</ul>
