<h1>Project Manager Extra Belt Review</h1>

<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Prepare you for black belt features you may see on an exam.</li>
    <li>Build many-to-many relationships into a full-featured application, to prepare for project week.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>Note: The ninja bonuses are features that you would see as Black Belt features. Indeed, some functionality on the dashboard would also likely be a black belt feature. This assignment is more difficult than a belt exam, so if you complete this assignment, you should be able to earn a black belt.</p>
