<h1>Display Date</h1>

<p>Your project manager needs you to make two templates for her front-end team: one to display the current date, and one to display the current time. Use the JSTL library to format the date so the front end developers can edit easily!</p>

<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Practice passing different kinds of data to the template.</li>
    <li>Become more comfortable with routing.</li>
    <li>Practice reading documentation & research skills to implement time formatting.</li>
    <li>Add CSS and JavaScript to your project.</li>
</ul>
