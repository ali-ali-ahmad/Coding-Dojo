<h1>Counter</h1>

<p>You need to keep track of how many times the same visitor visits a certain page. To do this, you will first need to write a basic counter. Create two pages, one that will show you how many times someone has visited the other.</p>

<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Practice using session to store data about a particular client's history with the app</li>
    <li>Be able to check whether a session variable exists</li>
    <li>Use dependency injection to initialize session</li>
    <li>Use getAttribute and setAttribute to read and modify session</li>
</ul>

<p>To Do List:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create and display a counter on http://your_server/counter</li>
    <li>Increment the counter on each visit to http://your_server/</li>
    <li>Counter must start at zero</li>
    <li>No errors regardless of which page is visited first</li>
    <li>NINJA BONUS: Create a third page that will increment the counter by 2</li>
    <li>NINJA BONUS: Create a reset button to set the counter back to zero</li>
</ul>
