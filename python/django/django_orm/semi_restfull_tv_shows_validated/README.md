<h1>Semi-Restful TV Shows Validated</h1>

<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Practice validating data before entering it into the database</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Let's add validations to your existing Semi-Restful TV Shows assignment! Building off of your existing assignment, implement the validations indicated on the green sticky notes to prevent dirty data from getting into your database. If a submission is invalid, display errors on the appropriate page.</p>

<p>To Do List:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Validate the Add a TV Show form to ensure all fields are populated appropriately before adding to the database.</li>
    <li>Display errors on the Add a TV Show form if the information is invalid.</li>
    <li>Validate the Edit Show form with the same validations as creation.</li>
    <li>Display errors on the Edit Show form if the information is invalid.</li>
    <li>NINJA BONUS: Ensure the Release Date is in the past.</li>
    <li>NINJA BONUS: Allow the description to be optional. If a description is provided, though, it should still be at least 10 characters.</li>
    <li>SENSEI BONUS: Validate that a TV show with that title does not already exist in the database before creating or updating.</li>
    <li>SENSEI BONUS: Do uniqueness validations (including displaying errors) for creating and updating using AJAX!</li>
</ul>
