<h1>Books/Authors (Shell)</h1>

<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Practice using the Django Shell to run ORM commands to manipulate our database</li>
    <li>Practice many-to-many relationships</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Create a new project called books_authors_proj and an app called books_authors_app. Use the following diagram as a guide for designing your models:</p>
