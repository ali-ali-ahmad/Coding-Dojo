<p>To Do List:</p>
<ul>

    <li>Add a route that renders this template and have it display a list of all the dojos and their associated ninjas</li>
    <li>Add a route to process the creation of a new dojo</li>
    <li>Add a route to process the creation of a new ninja; the dropdown on the form should be a list of all existing dojos</li>
    <li>NINJA BONUS: Add a delete button next to each dojo name that deletes that dojo (and all associated ninjas) from the database</li>
    <li>SENSEI BONUS: Add a count of ninjas next to each dojo name (eg. Ninjas at the Painting Dojo - 2; Ninjas at the Architecture Dojo - 0)</li>
</ul>
