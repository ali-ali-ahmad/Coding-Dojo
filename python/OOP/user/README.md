<h1>User</h1>

<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Practice creating a class and making instances from it</li>
    <li>Practice accessing the methods and attributes of different instances</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>If you've been following along, you're going to utilize the User class we've been discussing for this assignment.</p>

<p>For this assignment, we'll add some functionality to the User class:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>make_withdrawal(self, amount)</strong> - have this method decrease the user's balance by the amount specified</li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>display_user_balance(self)</strong> - have this method print the user's name and account balance to the terminal</p>
        <ul>
            <li>eg. "User: Guido van Rossum, Balance: $150</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>BONUS: transfer_money(self, other_user, amount)</strong> - have this method decrease the user's balance by the amount and add that amount to other other_user's balance</li>
</ul>

<p>To Do List:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a file with the User class, including the __init__ and make_deposit methods</li>
    <li>Add a make_withdrawal method to the User class</li>
    <li>Add a display_user_balance method to the User class</li>
    <li>Create 3 instances of the User class</li>
    <li>Have the first user make 3 deposits and 1 withdrawal and then display their balance</li>
    <li>Have the second user make 2 deposits and 2 withdrawals and then display their balance</li>
    <li>Have the third user make 1 deposits and 3 withdrawals and then display their balance</li>
    <li>BONUS: Add a transfer_money method; have the first user transfer money to the third user and then print both users' balances</li>
</ul>
