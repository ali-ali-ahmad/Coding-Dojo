<h1>For Loops: Basic I</h1>

<h3>Objectives:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Learn how to use basic for loop statements in Python</li>
    <li>Practice some basic algorithms in Python</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Create a Python file called for_loop_basic1.py that performs the following tasks.</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Basic</strong> - Print all integers from 0 to 150.</li>
    <li><strong>Multiples of Five</strong> - Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000</li>
    <li><strong>Counting, the Dojo Way</strong> - Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If divisible by 10, print "Coding Dojo".</li>
    <li><strong>Whoa. That Sucker's Huge</strong> - Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum.</li>
    <li><strong>Countdown by Fours</strong> - Print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting down by fours.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexible Counter</strong> - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)</li>
</ol>
