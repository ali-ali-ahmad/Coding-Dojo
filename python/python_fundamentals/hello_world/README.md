<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h3>Objectives:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Practice the different ways to concatenate and print strings</li>
    <li>Practice running a Python file</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>It's time to start creating Python files! As a rite of passage, our first program needs to be Hello World :). Let’s practice string concatenation. Copy the code below, replacing each of the <code>your code here</code> placeholders with the appropriate values. Hopefully it's not too patronizing that every other task below is running the file--this is just a friendly reminder to get into the habit of testing your code regularly!</p>

```python
# 1. TASK: print "Hello World"
print( your code here )
# 2. print "Hello Noelle!" with the name in a variable
name = "Noelle"
print( your code here )	# with a comma
print( your code here )	# with a +
# 3. print "Hello 42!" with the number in a variable
name = 42
print( your code here )	# with a comma
print( your code here )	# with a +	-- this one should give us an error!
# 4. print "I love to eat sushi and pizza." with the foods in variables
fave_food1 = "sushi"
fave_food2 = "pizza"
print( your code here ) # with .format()
print( your code here ) # with an f string


```
<p>To Do:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new Python file called hello_world.py</li>
    <li>Write the code to print a literal string saying "Hello World" (#1)</li>
    <li>Run the file</li>
    <li>Store your name in a variable, and then use it to print the string “Hello {{your name}}!” using a comma in the print function (#2a)</li>
    <li>Run the file</li>
    <li>Store your name in a variable, and then use it to print the string “Hello {{your name}}!” using a + in the print function (#2b)</li>
    <li>Run the file</li>
    <li>Store your favorite number in a variable, and then use it to print the string “Hello {{num}}!” using a comma in the print function (#3a)</li>
    <li>Run the file</li>
    <li>Store your favorite number in a variable, and then use it to print the string “Hello {{num}}!” using a + in the print function (#3b)</li>
    <li>Run the file</li>
    <li>NINJA BONUS: Figure out how to resolve the error from above, without changing the + sign to a comma</li>
    <li>Store 2 of your favorite foods in variables, and then use them to print the string “I love to eat {{food_one}} and {{food_two}}.” with the format method (#4a)</li>
    <li>Run the file</li>
    <li>Store 2 of your favorite foods in variables, and then use them to print the string “I love to eat {{food_one}} and {{food_two}}.” with f-strings (#4b)</li>
    <li>Run the file</li>
    <li>NINJA BONUS: Spend a few minutes playing around with other string methods to see what’s out there!</li>
</ul>
