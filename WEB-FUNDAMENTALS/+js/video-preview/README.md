<h1>Video Preview</h1>

<h2>Objectives:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Practice using <code>onmouseover</code> and <code>onmouseout</code></li>
  <li>Practice working from an existing code base</li>

</ul>

<p>For this assignment we'll be working with some existing code (<a href="https://github.com/alirabah93/Coding-Dojo/tree/master/WEB-FUNDAMENTALS/%2Bjs/video-preview/startingCode">here</a>) to add a video in. We'll want to find a free video that we want to work with from</p>

<p>https://www.pexels.com/videos/.  Next we'll want to add the video into a video tag in the HTML. To make the website more interactive add hover events to play and pause the video when hovering.</p>

<h2>Hints:</h2>

<p>We may need to make use of the <code>.play()</code> and <code>.pause()</code> methods - <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_video.asp">reference</a></p>

<p>We may also need the video to be <code>muted</code> as modern browsers want users to interact with (click) videos for them to start playing.</p>

<p>To Do List:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> into the existing project</li>
    <li>When hovering the video it should preview the content by playing the video on mute</li>
</ul>
