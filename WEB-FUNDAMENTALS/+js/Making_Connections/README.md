<h1>Assignment: </h1>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Add JavaScript functionality to a previous assignment</li>
    <li>Use JavaScript to remove <code>elements</code> from the webpage</li>
</ul>

<p>We've spent a lot of time working on some past projects and that hard work is something we can reuse. Let's return to the Profile Page assignment and add the types of <strong>JavaScript</strong> functionality we've previously learned onto it!</p>

<p>If we weren't happy with how ours turned out then feel free to use this already completed HTML and CSS<a href="">code</a>.</p>
