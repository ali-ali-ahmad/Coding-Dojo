<p>Using what we've learned about loops and conditionals, solve this classic coding challenge (it's been a favorite in interviews for years).</p>

<p>
Here's the HTML code:

<p></p>

<p>Write code that will go through each number from 1 to 100 and:</p>

<ul>
    <li>For each number that is a multiple of 3, print <code>"Fizz"</code></li>
    <li>For each number that is a multiple of 5, print <code>"Buzz"</code></li>
    <li>For numbers which are a multiple of both 3 and 5, print <code>"FizzBuzz"</code></li>
    <li>All other numbers should just print normally</li>
</ul>


<p>A short segment should look like</p>

```javaScript
1
2
"Fizz"
4
"Buzz"
"Fizz"
7
8
"Fizz"
"Buzz"
11
"Fizz"
13
14
"FizzBuzz"
```

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> We may need to make use of the modulo operator <code>a % b</code></p>
