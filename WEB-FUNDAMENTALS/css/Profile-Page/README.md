<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use what we've learned about <strong>CSS</strong> to recreate the following website</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a tricky assignment, let's make sure we build in layers working from the top down and from the outside to the inside.</p>

<p>This assignment may take us upwards of 4 hours to complete, this is normal as CSS can be time consuming. We strongly suggest working in groups, pair programming is a common programming practice.</p>

<p>You can find the avatar images and the icons within the folder</p>

<p>To Do List:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Draw on a sheet of paper all of the <code>divs</code> we expect to need to create the layout and name them with <code>ids</code> and <code>classes</code></li>
    <li>Recreate the look of the top navigation element</li>
    <li>Continue building the 2 column layout of this website, start with the rough boxes and add in the images and text as we go</li>
</ul>
