<h1>About Python</h1>

<p>Break down the image below into proper HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>Before you submit your work:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Remember that you're here to learn: Don't try to find the original source code of these images.</li>
    <li>Use 'python' images in the folder for this exercise.</li>
    <li>Make sure you've validated your HTML and that you're not using any float: left or right.</li>
    <li>For the ">>" on the list, don't worry about making it look exactly like >>. You can just use a normal circle for this assignment.</li>
    <li><strong>Do NOT make this responsive.  Just make this work for a fixed width (set the width to be 970px)</strong>.  You will go through our responsive design course later. For now, try to master the CSS principles for fixed width first.</li>
</ul>
