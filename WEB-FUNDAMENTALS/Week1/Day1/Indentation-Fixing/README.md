<p>Start coding!</p>
<p>For this assignment, you can use this <a href="https://github.com/TheCodingDojo/webFun_html_indentation">project</a> as a starting point.</p>
<p>Create a new file in your Text Editor (VS Code, Atom, Sublime...) and properly indent the code from the link</p>

<p>
  Please note that most of the tags in the second code have not been discussed yet. But at this point, you already know what opening and closing tags look like. Without knowing the HTML tags, determine what the parents, children, and siblings are by properly indenting the code from <a href="https://github.com/TheCodingDojo/webFun_html_indentation/blob/master/partII.html">Part II</a>
