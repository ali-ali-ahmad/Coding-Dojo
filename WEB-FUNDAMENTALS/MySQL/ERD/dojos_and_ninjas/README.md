<h1>Dojos and Ninjas</h1>

<h3>Objectives:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Practice designing ERDs with one-to-many relationships.</li>
</ol>

<p>Create an ERD to represent the database for an application that tracks dojos and the ninjas that belong to each.</p>

<p>Each dojo should have an id, name, created_at and updated_at; each ninja should have an id, first_name, last_name, age, created_at, updated_at and belong to a specific dojo. Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this diagram.</p>


<p>To Do List:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new model (ERD)</li>
    <li>Name the schema dojos_and_ninjas_schema</li>
    <li>Create a table called dojos</li>
    <li>Add the following fields to the dojos table: id, name, created_at and updated_at</li>
    <li>Create a table called ninjas</li>
    <li>Add the following fields to the ninjas table: id, first_name, last_name, age, created_at, updated_at and create an one to many relationship to the dojos table</li>
    <li>Change the name of the relationship field to the singular pronoun. ie dojo_id</li>
    <li>Take a screen shot of the ERD and upload the .png file</li>
</ul>
