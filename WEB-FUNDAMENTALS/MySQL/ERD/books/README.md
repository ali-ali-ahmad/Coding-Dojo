<h3>Objectives:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Practice designing ERDs with many-to-many relationships.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Create an ERD to represent the database for an application that tracks authors, books, and author's favorite books.</p>

<p>Each book should have an id, title, and each author should be able to save a list of their favorite books. Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this database.</p>


<p>To Do List:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new model (ERD)</li>
    <li>Name the schema books_schema</li>
    <li>Create a table called authors</li>
    <li>Add the following fields to the authors table: id, name, created_at and updated_at</li>
    <li>Create a table called books</li>
    <li>Add the following fields to the books table: id, title, num_of_pages, created_at, and updated_at</li>
    <li>Create a many to many relationship between authors and books and rename the joining table to favorites</li>
    <li>Change the field names to the singular pronoun. ie. author_id and book_id</li>
    <li>Take a screen shot of the ERD and upload the .png file</li>
</ul>
